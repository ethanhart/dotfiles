These are the dotfiles and configurations I use on my system.

The .bashrc has a number of custom bash prompts.
The .byobu/profile shows only the window list in screen.
The .vim contains all my colorschemes and all my vim plugins in the bundle folder (they are loaded by .vim/autoload/pathogen.vim)
The .vimrc contains my vim configuration and custom mappings.

In order to install set up Vim, place the .vim and .vimrc folder in your home directory and run :BundleInstall in Vim
